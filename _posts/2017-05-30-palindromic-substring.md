#### Palindromic Substring Problems ####

Palindrome is, like "racecar," a reversed and the original are exactly the same string.
I see many types of palindrome related problems.
Sometime, problems are based on palindromic *substrings*.
Sometime, those are palindromic *subsequences*.

The most typical problem is asking the longest palindromic substring or subsequence.
However, not just the longest, asking paritions is another popular problem.
As for partition problems, palindromes should be substrings.
This kind of problems has the same base - create a truthy table which expresses
from what to what indices are palindrome.

I'm going to write down three types of palindromic substring related problems:
the longest, minimum cuts, and printing all palindromes.


#### Problem Description ####

Always, a string will be given, for example, "abcbd."




#### The idea to find the longest ####

#### The idea to find minimum cuts ####

#### The idea to print all palindromic substrings ####


#### Java code  ####

Below is the Java code to find means anytime.

The result is:
